        making this silly dumb website for practice with HTML/CSS/JS while taking client side dev.
        honestly not quite sure what to put here yet, but it should be fun figuring it out in the meantime.
        im thinking i make it a personal blog of some sort (obviously) but dont know how personal to get because
        unfortunately it is public.

        i love the idea of a secret personal blog that is more in depth, but its hard to say whether that's
        something i can do with gh pages rn because it would have to be public on my github which i 
        would not be stoked about. perchance i will look into finding a way around it because i think that 
        would be cool. for now, i shall just make a semi-personal non-incriminating blog, i guess...
